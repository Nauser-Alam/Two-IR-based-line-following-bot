# Two IR Sensors Based Line Following Bot

## Overview

Welcome to the **Two IR Sensors Based Line Following Bot** project! This repository contains the code for a line-following robot that uses two infrared (IR) sensors for detecting and following lines. The project is designed to provide a straightforward and effective solution for creating a robotic vehicle that can navigate along a path marked by a line.

## Features

- **Dual IR Sensors Configuration:** Uses two IR sensors for precise line detection, allowing the bot to distinguish between the line and the surrounding environment.
- **Adaptive Control System:** Continuously adjusts the bot's movement based on real-time sensor data, providing smooth and accurate navigation.
- **Easy to Implement and Customize:** The code is modular and well-documented, making it easy for users to understand, modify, and enhance the bot's capabilities.
- **Robust and Tested:** The code has been rigorously tested in various conditions and line patterns, ensuring its reliability and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Two IR sensors
- Motor drivers (e.g., L298N)
- A robotic platform with motors
- Basic electronics components (e.g., resistors, jumper wires)

### Hardware Setup

Follow these steps to set up your hardware:

1. **Sensor Placement:** Mount the two IR sensors on the front of the robot, ensuring they are aligned and have a clear view of the ground.
2. **Microcontroller Connection:** Connect the sensors and motors to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram provided in the `/docs` folder.
3. **Motor Driver Connection:** Connect the motors to the motor driver, and then connect the motor driver to the microcontroller.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nauser-Alam/line-following-bot.git
